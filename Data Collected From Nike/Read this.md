# JSON That Been Collected From Nike.com

Through my research of Nike's website I have found that Nike uses two different types of webpages (not inclueding nike ID), due to this they also formate their JSON defferent. Both of these webpages use javascript with the JSON data to formate the overall look of the webpageon the front-end. The javascript disable and enable elements of the HTML (ex. size in stock).

## Webpage 1 - New Json Formate

- [ ] try to locate the Client ID within the json
- [ ] Locate the indacation of the sizes in stock

## Webpage 2 - Old Json Formate

- [ ] try to locate the Client ID within the json
- [x] Locate the indacation of the sizes in stock
